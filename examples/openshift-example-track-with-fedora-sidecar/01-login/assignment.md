# Working with theÂ Command Line Interface (CLI)

Let's begin by connecting to OpenShift.

From *Terminal 1*, run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI:

```
oc login -u admin -p admin https://api.crc.testing:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

You should see:

```bash
Login successful.
You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running `oc new-project <projectname>`
```

Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift cluster.

Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI:

```
oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```

Copy the URL from the output of the above command and open it in your browser.

We'll deploy our app as the `admin` user. Use the following credentials:

* Username:
```
admin
```
* Password:
```
admin
```
