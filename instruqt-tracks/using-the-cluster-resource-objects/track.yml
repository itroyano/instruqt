  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) as a management framework for Linux containers.|

  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * Understanding how to inspect OpenShift resource objects using the `oc` command line tool
  * Learning how to create an OpenShift application at the command line
  * Learning how to create OpenShift resource objects from using the command `oc create`
  * Learning how to update OpenShift resource objects from using the command `oc edit`
  * Learning how to replace OpenShift resource objects from using the command `oc update`
  * Learning how to delete OpenShift resource objects from using the command `oc delete`
