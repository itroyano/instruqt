üíª Working with the¬†Command Line Interface (CLI)
===============================================

The `oc` command lets you administer your OpenShift cluster and deploy new applications.

The CLI exposes the underlying Kubernetes orchestration system with the enhancements made by OpenShift.

The `oc` command provides all of the functionality of the Kubernetes `kubectl` CLI tool, in addition to specific OpenShift operations.


üîí Logging in with the CLI
=======================

Log into OpenShift from the command line on the left using the `oc login` command:

```
oc login -u admin -p admin https://api.crc.testing:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

‚úÖ Login Confirmation
==================

Verify you succesfully logged in as the `admin` user with the `oc whoami` command:

```
oc whoami
```
