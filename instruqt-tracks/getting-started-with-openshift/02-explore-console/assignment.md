üìÅ Understanding projects in OpenShift
===================================

OpenShift has an organizational unit called a **project**.
You use a **project** to group resources relating to your application.
The reason for organizing your application in a **project** is to enable controlled access and quotas for developers or teams.

You can think of a **project** as a visualization of the Kubernetes namespace based on the developer access controls.

üèóÔ∏è Creating a project
====================

1. From the OpenShift Web Console, click **+Add** on the left side menu.

2. Click **Create a project** and name the project `myproject`.
