  In this self-paced tutorial, you will learn the basics of how to use OpenShift Serverless, which provides a development model to remove the overhead of server provisioning and maintenance from the developer.

  In this tutorial, you will:
  * Deploy an OpenShift Serverless `service`.
  * Deploy multiple `revisions` of a service.
  * Understand the `underlying compents` of a serverless service.
  * Understand how Serverless is able to `scale-to-zero`.
  * Run different revisions of a service via `canary` and `blue-green` deployments.
  * Utilize the `knative client`.

  ## Why Serverless?

  Deploying applications as Serverless services is becoming a popular architectural style. It seems like many organizations assume that _Functions as a Service (FaaS)_ implies a serverless architecture. We think it is more accurate to say that FaaS is one of the ways to utilize serverless, although it is not the only way. This raises a super critical question for enterprises that may have applications which could be monolith or a microservice: What is the easiest path to serverless application deployment?

  The answer is a platform that can run serverless workloads, while also enabling you to have complete control of the configuration, building, and deployment. Ideally, the platform also supports deploying the applications as linux containers.

  ## OpenShift Serverless

  In this chapter we introduce you to one such platform -- [OpenShift Serverless][serverless-main].  OpenShift Serverless helps developers to deploy and run applications that will scale up or scale to zero on-demand. Applications are packaged as OCI compliant Linux containers that can be run anywhere.  This is known as `Serving`.

  Serverless has a robust way to allow for applications to be triggered by a variety of event sources, such as events from your own applications, cloud services from multiple providers, Software as a Service (SaaS) systems and Red Hat Services ([AMQ Streams][amq-docs]).  This is known as `Eventing`.

  OpenShift Serverless applications can be integrated with other OpenShift services, such as OpenShift [Pipelines][pipelines-main], and [Service Mesh][service-mesh-main], delivering a complete serverless application development and deployment experience.

  This tutorial will focus on the `Serving` aspect of OpenShift Serverless as the first diagram showcases.  Be on the lookout for additional tutorials to dig further into Serverless, specifically `Eventing`.

  ## The Environment

  The OpenShift environment created for you is running version 4.11 of the OpenShift Container Platform. This deployment is a self-contained environment that provides everything you need to be successful learning the platform. This includes a preconfigured command line environment, the OpenShift web console, public URLs, and sample applications.

  > **Note:** *It is possible to skip around in this tutorial.  The only pre-requisite for each section would be the initial `Prepare for Exercises` section.*
  >
  > *For example, you could run the `Prepare for Exercises` section immediately followed by the `Scaling` section.*
